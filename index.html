                <p>Solar energy is a renewable energy source. Refers to the sun's thermal radiation energy, the main performance is often said that the sun's rays. The utilization of solar energy includes photothermal conversion and photoelectric conversion. Solar power generation is an emerging renewable energy source. Solar energy in a broad sense also includes wind energy, chemical energy, and water energy on the earth.</p>

                    Solar energy is an inexhaustible green and renewable energy source for mankind. The utilization of solar energy has significant advantages: cleanness of utilization; universality of existence; "infinity" of reserves. Solar energy, like wind energy, tidal energy and other clean energy sources, does not produce any pollution during its development and utilization, and its infinite reserves make it an ideal alternative energy source for human beings.

                    There are many ways to use solar energy, mainly in the following three forms:
                </b>
                <p>
                    (1) Photochemical utilization of solar energy. Including: solar photosynthesis, solar chemical storage, solar catalysis photo-splitting water for hydrogen production, solar photoelectrochemical conversion and other new technologies, among which solar hydrogen production technology will probably be one of the key technologies to promote the large-scale utilization of solar energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Solar thermal utilization. The solar radiation energy is converted into thermal energy through the conversion device. At present, the main forms of solar thermal utilization include solar water heaters, solar seawater desalination, solar cookers, solar thermal power generation, and high-temperature solar furnaces. Among them, the application of solar water heater is the most common and commercialized technical product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) Photovoltaic utilization of solar energy. The solar radiation energy is converted into electric energy by the conversion device, which belongs to the solar photovoltaic power generation technology. Photoelectric conversion devices usually use the photovoltaic effect principle of semiconductor devices to perform photoelectric conversion, so it is also called solar photovoltaic technology. Photovoltaic utilization of solar energy is the main form of solar energy utilization.

                    At present, there are two methods of solar power generation, one is to convert solar energy into thermal energy, and then generate electricity in a conventional way through hot steam, which is called solar thermal power generation. The other is solar photovoltaic power generation. Due to the random size of photovoltaic power generation, independent power generation, short construction time and simple maintenance, photovoltaic power generation technology has developed rapidly since the 1970s.
Typical photovoltaic power generation systems are divided into independent type and grid-connected type, mainly including solar cell arrays, converters, controllers and other parts, and independent systems usually also include batteries. Figure 1 shows the composition of a grid-connected photovoltaic power generation system, in which the converter can invert the electric energy generated by the photovoltaic cell into a sinusoidal current and connect it to the grid or supply the load. The controller mainly controls the tracking of the maximum power point of the solar photovoltaic cell and the inverter. output power and current waveform of the device. The solar cell array is the core of the photovoltaic power generation system, and its function is to directly convert the solar energy into electrical energy in the form of direct current.

                    In 2009, the installed capacity of solar cells in the world increased by 45%, reaching a total of 22.9GW. Experts predict that by 2050, solar photovoltaic power generation in the world will account for 13% to 15% of the total power generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At present, photovoltaic power generation is mainly concentrated in Japan, the European Union and the United States, and its photovoltaic power generation accounts for about 80% of the world's photovoltaic power generation. As of the end of 2009, the cumulative installed capacity of only the United States was 1100MW, and the cumulative installed capacity of my country reached 300MW. On August 12, Shi Dinghuan, Counselor of the State Council and Chairman of China Renewable Energy Association, predicted at the "Second China-Europe International Solar Photovoltaic Industry Development Forum" held in Shanghai that the installed capacity of solar photovoltaic power generation in China in 2010 will reach 1GW, and it is expected to reach 1GW in 2015. 5GW, and 20GW in 2020.

                    Since the 1990s, the production capacity of photovoltaic modules in my country has increased year by year, the cost has been continuously reduced, and the market has continued to expand. In 2009, my country's solar cell output exceeded 4000MW, accounting for 40% of the global total, ranking first in the world. 90% of China's solar cells are exported overseas, making it the world's largest export base.

                In order to promote the development of the domestic photovoltaic power generation market, the state has made two efforts. One is to subsidize the grid-connected electricity price, such as the photovoltaic grid-connected power generation concession project; the other is to subsidize the construction of photovoltaic systems, such as Golden Sun and building integration. Shi Lishan, deputy director of the New Energy Department of the National Energy Administration, said that it can be basically determined that the future on-grid electricity price of photovoltaic power plants will still be determined mainly through bidding. With the advancement of technology and the decline of solar production costs and the support of national policies, the development prospects of solar photovoltaic power generation will be very broad. It is believed that in the near future, solar power generation devices will also be used in thousands of households like solar water heaters.
